# Password-Manager

This is a little project ive made for fun to store passwords and users, main goal was to to learn about java fx.
This project's main idea is to store username-password pairs in a table to be used or seen later.
The files the manager produces are encryped binary files.

To use the manager first of all create a new user.
Login with the user created.

The second widow has few functions:
1. A field to check if any password is strong enough.
2. Generating random password with digits, symbols, lower and upper case letters with the size between 14 to 16.
3. A table to store the passwords you wish to use later.
